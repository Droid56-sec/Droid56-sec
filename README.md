- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Droid56-sec
-  Iâ€™m interested in increasing my knowledge on cybersecurity and I will be posting my research and projects here.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of cybersecurity and it's tools.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on entry-level cybersecurity.
-  I'm looking to develop my written, verbal skills and learb programming.
-  I decided to improve and learn in cybersecurity because I want to keep everyones private information safe and invulnerable to attacks.
-  what interest me about the field of security is how it keeps evolving through the years and how much we need it. I Feel that in the close future cybersecurity will be ten times more crucial than it is now. Another thing would be that there is so much knowledge to learn that increases the excitement and exploration.
